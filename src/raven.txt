Once upon a 
midnight dreary, 
while I pondered, 
weak and weary, 
Over many a 
quaint and curious 
volume of forgotten 
lore, While 
I nodded, nearly 
napping, suddenly 
there came a 
tapping, As 
of some one 
gently rapping, 
rapping at my 
chamber door. 
"'Tis some visitor," 
I muttered, 
"tapping at 
my chamber door- 
Only this, and 
nothing more." 
Ah, distinctly 
I remember it 
was in the bleak 
December, And 
each separate 
dying ember 
wrought its 
ghost upon the 
floor. Eagerly 
I wished the 
morrow;- vainly 
I had sought 
to borrow From 
my books surcease 
of sorrow- sorrow 
for the lost 
Lenore- For 
the rare and 
radiant maiden 
whom the angels 
name Lenore- 
Nameless here 
for evermore. 
And the silken, 
sad, uncertain 
rustling of 
each purple 
curtain Thrilled
